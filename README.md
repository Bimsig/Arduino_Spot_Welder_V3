# Arduino_Spot_Welder_V3

This is the latest V3 of the Arduino Spot Welder. The previous V2 can be found here https://github.com/KaeptnBalu/Arduino_Spot_Welder_V2

An Arduino based Spot Welder for battery welding http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Arduino-Battery-Spot-Welder/
Build Video coming soon.

This Spot Welder can be used to weld 18650 batteries. It uses a 12V car battery as welding current supply. Typically one 40Ah 440A battery delivers enough current to get good welds with 0.15mm nickel strips and even 0.25mm nickel strips. For thicker nickel strips maybe you will need bigger battery or two in paralell.

The Welder generates a double pulse, where the first one is 12% of the time of the second one by default. Pulse time of the main pulse is adjustable by the rotary encoder and displayed on the screen in mS so you can exactly adjust the time. Its adjustable from 1 â€¦ 999 mS.
