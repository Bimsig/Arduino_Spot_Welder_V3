Use the PDF template to cut the aluminum pieces from 4mm material.

The u-shaped piece is optional. You can either solder the thick wire bend to an u-shape directly to the pcb as before or cut this aluminum piece and screw it with m2 screws to the pcb.

You can also take a look at the 3d and dxf drawings to manufacture the aluminum parts with a cnc or something else.
