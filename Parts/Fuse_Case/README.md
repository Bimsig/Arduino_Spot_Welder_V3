These are the STL Files for the ANL Fuse case.
Printable without any support needed.

If you are using the Spot Welder with a Lipo battery it is recommended to use a 300A ANLfuse and put it in a case to prevent any electric short circuits.
In case you are not able to print the fuse case, at least wrap some electrical tape arround the fuse to isolate it.
